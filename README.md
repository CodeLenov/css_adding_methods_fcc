CSS Foundations Exercise A

Objective: In this exercise, you're going to practice adding CSS to an HTML file using all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. You should only be using type selectors for this exercise when adding styles via the external and internal methods. You should also use keywords for colors (e.g. "blue") instead of using RGB or HEX values.

2. The CSS of the div element should be added externally by using a type selector.
3. You should see a p element with a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px.
